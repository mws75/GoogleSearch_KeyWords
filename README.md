# GoogleSearch_KeyWords
Type in a Google Search url, and output will be csv's containing keywords which are obtained from the recommended searches as well as related searches. 

This script is used to find key words related to a specific google search.  You need to copy and paste the url to the Google search you want to perform.
Ex:   I googled: "What are the best tools for finding Instagram influencers"
Then I copy and paste the URL into my code (in this version it is line 15).

url = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=What+are+the+best+tools+for+finding+Instagram+influencers&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS601US601&oq=What+are+the+best+tools+for+finding+Instagram+influencers&aqs=chrome..69i57.24849j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8'

I also need to add the Related Search Value.  This can be different or the same, depending on what you are looking for. 

I have not added a function that excludes generic words like 'the', 'a', 'to'...
